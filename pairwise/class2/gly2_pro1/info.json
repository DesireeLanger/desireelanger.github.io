    "description":"Pairwise comparison of the Class II catalytic domains from the Tetrameric glycyl tRNA Synthetase (t-GlyRS) and Prolyl tRNA Synthetase (Archaeal-like) (ProRS-A) families. \n\tMonomeric structures from the two families were aligned using 3DCOMB. The cross-family RMSD is the average RMSD between pairs of structures from different families, and is\n\t larger than the total RMSD, which compares structures both within- and between-families. ",
