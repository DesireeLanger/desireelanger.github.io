    "description":"Pairwise comparison of the Class II catalytic domains from the Mitochondrial Phenylalanyl tRNA Synthetase (m-PheRS) and Prolyl tRNA Synthetase (Bacterial-like) (ProRS-B) families. \n\tMonomeric structures from the two families were aligned using 3DCOMB. The cross-family RMSD is the average RMSD between pairs of structures from different families, and is\n\t larger than the total RMSD, which compares structures both within- and between-families. ",
