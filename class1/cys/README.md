Cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase (CysRS) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in protein synthesis by catalysing the attachment of cysteine to its cognate tRNA:




$ \text{Cys} + \text{tRNA}^\text{Cys} + \text{ATP} \xrightarrow{\text{CysRS}} \text{Cys-tRNA}^\text{Cys} + \text{AMP} + \text{PP}_i  $




Unlike many other AARS, CysRS does not seem to require editing activity to attain its remarkable degree of specificity, and is able to discriminate against alanine and serine quite effectively (Fersht et al. 1979, Hou and Perona, 2005).
This may be explained by the use of zinc ions to coordinate cysteine binding, facilitated by conserved side chains of cysteine and histidine residues in the active site (Newberry et al. 2002).
Anticodon loop recongition is achieved entirely by the C-terminal $\alpha/\beta$ domain (Hauenstein et al. 2004).
This resides downstream from the helical bundle which recognises the anticodon in many other Class I synthetases (Hou and Perona, 2005). 
In CysRS however, the helical bundle plays a different role in tRNA recognition (Hauenstein et al. 2004).
tRNA binding may be further coordinated by a disordered module on the surface of the catalytic domain - the CysRS insertion module (Newberry et al. 2002). <br><br>




CysRS behaves as a monomer in some organisms, and as a homodimer in others (Motorin et al. 1997).
While eukaryotes typically possess distinct genes encoding cytosolic and mitochodrial CysRS, yeast produces both forms from a single CysRS gene using alternative transcription state sites (Nishimura et al. 2019). 
The enzyme is lacking in many methanogenic archaea, which instead utilise [SepRS](/class2/sep) to encode cysteine (Sauerwald et al. 2005).
