The class I lysyl-tRNA synthetase (LysRS-I) is a monomeric enzyme that plays a crucial role in protein synthesis by catalysing the attachment of the amino acid arginine to its cognate tRNA:




$ \text{Lys} + \text{tRNA}^\text{Lys} + \text{Lys} \xrightarrow{\text{LysRS-I}} \text{Lys-tRNA}^\text{Lys} + \text{AMP} + \text{PP}_i  $




The C-terminal anticodon binding domain is &alpha;-helical rich and is very similar to that of [GluRS](/class1/glu1) (Terada et al. 2002), but quite distinct from the other members of  subclass 1b. 
However, the catalytic domain is not immediately related to any other Class I syntheatases, and as such, the enzyme does not belong to a subclass.





The N-terminal catalytic domain of LysRS-I is quite typical of a Class I synthetase.
Like most members of the superfamily, ATP binding is coordinated by the backbone brackets (Kaiser et al. 2018). The catalytic domain is the standard four stranded Rossman fold, with the additional fifth strand found in some members of the family. Editing activity has not been characteristed for LysRS-I (Gomez and Ibba  2020).     


The class I LysRS is present in most archaea and some bacteria. Whereas, eukaryotes and most bacteria instead have a [class II LysRS](/class2/lys). These two variants are from different superfamilies and are often presented as an example of convergent evolution.
