Arginyl-tRNA synthetase (ArgRS) is a homodimeric enzyme that plays a crucial role in protein synthesis by catalysing the attachment of the amino acid arginine to its cognate tRNA:



$ \text{Arg} + \text{tRNA}^\text{Arg} + \text{ATP} \xrightarrow{\text{ArgRS}} \text{Arg-tRNA}^\text{Arg} + \text{AMP} + \text{PP}_i  $



Unlike most class I or class II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, ArgRS requires the presence of tRNA$^\text{Arg}$ for arginine activation (Mitra et al. 1967, Eriani and Cavarelli 2005).

tRNA binding is coordinated by the N- and C-terminal domains, which are adjacent in the tertiary structure (Cavarelli et al. 1998). 
The C-terminal domain is a four helix bundle which recognises the anticodon, whereas the N-terminal domain is a two layer &alpha;/&beta; unit which recognises the D-loop.
Structural and mutation studies suggest that the interaction between the N-terminal domain and the D-loop are not stable, and deletion of the N-terminal domain has only a small effect on tRNA aminoacylation activity (Konno et al. 2009).
 Furthermore,  the orientation of this domain relative to the catalytic domain also varies across structures (Shimada et al.2001). 
The N-terminal domain is characteristic of ArgRS and is lacking in other class I structures whereas the C-terminal anticodon binding domain is related to that in 
[CysRS](/class1/cys), [LeuRS](/class1/leu1), [ValRS](/class1/val), [MetRS](/class1/met), and [IleRS](/class1/ile).
ArgRS is also characterised by its ability to charge tRNAs corresponding to six different codons. In the standard genetic code, leucine and serine are the only other amino acids which are encoded by six codons.




The catalytic domain is typical of a class I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase, and is a five-stranded parallel Rossman fold.  Arginine binding in the active site is coordinated by two salt bridges (with two acidic residues) and one hydrogen bond (with a tyrosine) and these three residues are strongly conserved in ArgRS (Cavarelli et al. 1998). Like most members of the superfamily, ATP binding is coordinated by the backbone brackets (Kaiser et al. 2018). ArgRS is characterised by a bundle of $\alpha$ helices after the HIGH motif - the ArgRS insertion module.
This modular bundle exists in most class I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, and changes in composition quite rapidly both between and within families, however is more extensive in ArgRS compared with other families. The catalytic domain is not immediately related to any other aminoacyl-tRNA syntheatses, and as such, ArgRS does not belong to a subclass. 





While most class I aminoacyl-tRNA syntheases are monomeric, ArgRS is homodimeric. In some archaea, this dimer assembles into a complex with [SerRS](/class2/ser1), which has been reported to increase the efficieny of SerRS under extreme conditions (Godinic-Mikulcic et al. 2011). 
It appears that ArgRS lacks editing activity (Gomez and Ibba 2020).
