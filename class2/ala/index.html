					C-terminal domain is associated with editing (<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.1174343">Guo 2009</a>, <a href="https://www.rcsb.org/structure/3G98#entity-1">rcsb</a>).

					AlaRS catalyses the following reaction: <br>


					<ul>
						<li>Ala + tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> + ATP &rightarrow; Ala-tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> + AMP + PP<sub>i</sub> </li>
					</ul>


					The catalytic core of AlaRS is similar to the <a href="../gly2">tetrameric GlyRS</a> found mainly in bacteria.
					Although the class II superfamily phylogeny is not entirely clear, these two members appear to be closely related, constituting subclass IIc or IId depending on the author (Valencia-Sánchez et al. 2016, Gomez et al. 2020). <br><br>


					AlaRS is one of the larger members of the class II superfamily, and contains a unique domain architecture. Homodimerisation in AlaRS occurs via a C-terminal coiled coil, unlike most class II families which dimerise at the cataytic core (Naganuma et al. 2009). Moreover, the alpha helix rich tRNA binding domain primarily recognises elements within the acceptor stem of tRNA, as opposed to the anticodon (Naganuma et al. 2009).  <br><br>


					There catalytic domain of AlaRS lacks a stretch of short secondary structural elements between motifs 1 and 2, which are typically found in other class II proteins. Aside from this idiosyncrasy, the catalytic domain is fairly standard and contains all seven antiparallel strands. Like most members of the superfamily, ATP binding is coordinated by the arginine tweezers, located in motifs 2 and 3 (Kaiser et al. 2018).  <br><br>





					Editing in AlaRS occurs at both the pre-transfer and post-transfer levels. Pre-transfer editing occurs through a C-terminal editing domain, which expunges mischarged glycyl and seryl groups from tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> (Tsui et al. 1981, Guo et al. 2009b). At the post-transfer level, AlaX proteins (which are homologous with he C-terminal editing domain of AlaRS) also target Ser-tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> (Beebe et al. 2008). This double checkpoint system minimises serine-for-alanline mistranslations, which are known to cause profound problems in nature (Guo et al. 2009a, Schimmel 2011). The C-ala domain is tethered to the editing domain through a coiled coil, and promotes cooperative binding between the cataytic core and the editing domains to tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> (Guo et al. 2009b). The editing domain of AlaRS is downstream of the catalytic domain, and is homologous with that of <a href="../thr">ThrRS</a>, which is conversely resides upstream of the catalytic domain  (Sankaranarayanan et al. 1999).
