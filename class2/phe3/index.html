						Phenylalanyl tRNA synthetase (PheRS) is an enzyme which attaches phenylalanine to its cognate tRNA: <br><br>


					<ul>
						<li>Phe + tRNA<sup>Phe</sup> + ATP &rightarrow; Phe-tRNA<sup>Phe</sup> + AMP + PP<sub>i</sub> </li>
					</ul>


					PheRS is probably the most complex of amino acyl tRNA synthetases (Klipcan et al. 2010). While most members of the class II superfamily are homodimeric, this enzyme operates as a heterotetramer &alpha;<sub>2</sub>&beta;<sub>2</sub>. 
					In total, there are three known variants of PheRS, and a total of five class II families (Finarov et al. 2010).
					Two of these variants are tetrameric - one predominantly found in bacteria (b-PheRS) and one in eukaryotes/archaea (e-PheRS) - while the other variant is monomeric - and found in mitochondria.
					This page details the &alpha; subunit of the eukaryotic variant. Also see the <a href="../phe4">eukaryotic &beta; subunit</a>, the <a href="../phe1">bacterial alpha subunit</a>, the  <a href="../phe4">bacterial beta subunit</a>, and the <a href="../phe5">mitochondrial PheRS</a>. <br><br>


						Although both eukaryotic subunits possess a class II catalytic domain, catalytic activity appears to be restricted to the &alpha; subunit. tRNA recognition also occurs in the &alpha; chain (in contrast to the bacterial tetramer), while editing activity is restricted to &beta;.  <br><br>


						The C-terminal catalytic core of &alpha; is similar to that of the other PheRS familes, as well as <a href="../sep">SepRS</a> and <a href="../pyl">PylRS</a>. Collectivey, these members constitute subclass IIc (Kavran et al. 2007, Perona et al. 2012, Valencia-Sánchez et al. 2016, Gomez et al. 2020). <br><br>


						The catalytic domain of &alpha;-PheRS is similar to other class II members, and contains six antiparallel strands. Like most members of the superfamily, ATP binding is coordinated by the arginine tweezers, located in motifs 2 and 3 (Kaiser et al. 2018). Much like the bacterial form, the sequence at the position of motif 1 is fairly distant to other class members.   <br><br>



						The anticodon binding domain is hypothesised to be a short loop upstream of the catalytic core (Finarov et al. 2010). The N-terminal domains resemble DNA binding proteins, however their function roles are still under investigation (Ho et al. 2022).  <br><br>
