					The archaeal-like phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase (PheRS-A) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in protein synthesis by catalysing the attachment of the amino acid phenylalanine to its cognate tRNA:



					<div class="reaction">
						<span>
							$ \text{Phe} + \text{tRNA}^\text{Phe} + \text{ATP} \xrightarrow{\text{PheRS-A}} \text{Phe-tRNA}^\text{Phe} + \text{AMP} + \text{PP}_i  $
						</span>
					</div>


					The phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetases (PheRS) are considered to be one of the most evolutionarily complex enzymes among aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (Klipcan et al. 2010).
					Unlike most members of the class II superfamily, which are homodimeric, PheRS-A operates as a heterotetramer composed of two &alpha; and two &beta; subunits &alpha;<sub>2</sub>&beta;<sub>2</sub>. 
					There are three known variants of PheRS: one found predominantly in eukaryotes/archaea, one found in bacteria (<a href="../phe1">PheRS-B</a>), and one localsied to eukaryotic mitochondria (<a href="../phe3">PheRS-M</a>). 
					This page specifically refers to the &alpha; subunit of the archaeal/eukaryotic variant (PheRS-A&alpha;). <br><br>



						Although both PheRS-A subunits possess a class II catalytic domain, catalytic activity appears to be restricted to the &alpha; subunit. tRNA recognition also occurs in the &alpha; chain (in contrast to the bacterial tetramer, for which tRNA binding occurs through the &beta; chain), and editing activity is restricted to &beta;.  The C-terminal catalytic core of PheRS-A&alpha; is similar to that of the other PheRS familes, as well as <a href="../sep">SepRS</a> and <a href="../pyl">PylRS</a>. Collectivey, these members constitute subclass IIc (Kavran et al. 2007, Perona et al. 2012, Valencia-Sánchez et al. 2016, Gomez et al. 2020). <br><br>


						The catalytic domain of PheRS-A&alpha; is similar to other class II members, and contains six antiparallel strands. Like most members of the superfamily, ATP binding is coordinated by the arginine tweezers, located in motifs 2 and 3 (Kaiser et al. 2018).  
						This families' catalytic domain is characterised by the short <a href="/superfamily/class2/PheRS-Aα_IM">PheRS-A&alpha; insertion module</a>, which resides between motifs 2 and 3. <br><br>



						The anticodon binding domain is proposed to be a short loop upstream of the catalytic core (Finarov et al. 2010). The N-terminal domains resemble DNA binding proteins, however their function roles are still under investigation (Ho et al. 2022).  <br><br>
