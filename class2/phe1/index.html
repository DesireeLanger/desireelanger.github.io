					The bacterial-like phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase (PheRS-B) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in protein synthesis by catalysing the attachment of the amino acid phenylalanine to its cognate tRNA:



					<div class="reaction">
						<span>
							$ \text{Phe} + \text{tRNA}^\text{Phe} + \text{ATP} \xrightarrow{\text{PheRS-B}} \text{Phe-tRNA}^\text{Phe} + \text{AMP} + \text{PP}_i  $
						</span>
					</div>




					The phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetases (PheRS) are considered to be one of the most evolutionarily complex enzymes among aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (Klipcan et al. 2010).
					Unlike most members of the class II superfamily, which are homodimeric, PheRS-B operates as a heterotetramer composed of two &alpha; and two &beta; subunits &alpha;<sub>2</sub>&beta;<sub>2</sub>. 
					There are three known variants of PheRS: one found predominantly in bacteria, one found in eukaryotes/archaea (<a href="../phe3">PheRS-A</a>), and one localsied to eukaryotic mitochondria (<a href="../phe3">PheRS-M</a>). 
					This page specifically refers to the &alpha; subunit of the bacterial variant (PheRS-B&alpha;). <br><br>




					Although both subunits of PheRS-B possess a class II catalytic domain, catalytic activity appears to be restricted to the &alpha; subunit. tRNA recognition and editing activity is restricted to &beta; which is over twice the size of &alpha; (Fishman et al. 2001). 
					The only other tetameric member of class II is the <a href="../gly2">bacterial GlyRS</a>, which is also composed of two catalytic &alpha; subunits and two non-catalytic &beta; subunits. 
					However unlike GlyRS, catalysis in PheRS is not attainable without the full tetrameric &alpha;<sub>2</sub>&beta;<sub>2</sub> assembly; monomers and dimers do not possess such activity (Mosyak et al. 1995).
					PheRS binds two tRNA molecules, where each tRNA binds across all four subunits (Goldgur et al. 1997).
					<br><br>


					The C-terminal catalytic core of &alpha; is similar to that of the other PheRS familes, as well as <a href="../sep">SepRS</a> and <a href="../pyl">PylRS</a>. Collectivey, these members constitute subclass IIc (Kavran et al. 2007, Perona et al. 2012, Valencia-Sánchez et al. 2016, Gomez et al. 2020). <br><br>


					The catalytic domain of &alpha;-PheRS is similar to other class II members, and contains six antiparallel strands. Like most members of the superfamily, ATP binding is coordinated by the arginine tweezers, located in motifs 2 and 3 (Kaiser et al. 2018). The flexible N-terminal helical arm (A1) is intrinsically disordered, however it adopts a coiled coil structure upon interaction with the tRNA (Goldgur et al. 1997). Editing in the bacterial PheRS is performed by the <a href="../phe2">&beta; subunit</a>. <br><br>
