						Phenylalanyl tRNA synthetase (PheRS) is an enzyme which attaches phenylalanine to its cognate tRNA: <br><br>


					<ul>
						<li>Phe + tRNA<sup>Phe</sup> + ATP &rightarrow; Phe-tRNA<sup>Phe</sup> + AMP + PP<sub>i</sub> </li>
					</ul>


					PheRS is probably the most complex of amino acyl tRNA synthetases (Klipcan et al. 2010). While most members of the class II superfamily are homodimeric, this enzyme operates as a heterotetramer &alpha;<sub>2</sub>&beta;<sub>2</sub>. 
					In total, there are three known variants of PheRS, and a total of five class II families (Finarov et al. 2010).
					Two of these variants are heterotetrameric - one predominantly found in bacteria (b-PheRS) and one in eukaryotes/archaea (e-PheRS) - while the other variant is monomeric - and found in mitochondria.
					This page details the &alpha; subunit of the bacterial variant. Also see the <a href="../phe2">bacterial &beta; subunit</a>, the <a href="../phe3">eukaryotic &alpha; subunit</a>, the  <a href="../phe4">eukaryotic &beta; subunit</a>, and the <a href="../phe5">mitochondrial PheRS</a>. <br><br>


					Although both bacterial subunits possess a class II catalytic domain, catalytic activity appears to be restricted to the &alpha; subunit. tRNA recognition and editing activity is restricted to &beta; which is over twice the size of &alpha; (Fishman et al. 2001). 
					The only other tetameric member of class II is the <a href="../gly2">bacterial GlyRS</a>, which is also composed of two catalytic &alpha; subunits and two non-catalytic &beta; subunits. 
					However unlike GlyRS, catalysis in PheRS is not attainable without the full tetrameric &alpha;<sub>2</sub>&beta;<sub>2</sub> assembly; monomers and dimers do not possess such activity (Mosyak et al. 1995).
					PheRS binds two tRNA molecules, where each tRNA binds across all four subunits (Goldgur et al. 1997).
					<br><br>


					The C-terminal catalytic core of &alpha; is similar to that of the other PheRS familes, as well as <a href="../sep">SepRS</a> and <a href="../pyl">PylRS</a>. Collectivey, these members constitute subclass IIc (Kavran et al. 2007, Perona et al. 2012, Valencia-Sánchez et al. 2016, Gomez et al. 2020). <br><br>


					The catalytic domain of &alpha;-PheRS is similar to other class II members, and contains six antiparallel strands rather than seven. Like most members of the superfamily, ATP binding is coordinated by the arginine tweezers, located in motifs 2 and 3 (Kaiser et al. 2018). The sequence at the position of motif 1 is fairly distant to other class members.  The flexible N-terminal helical arm (A1) is intrinsically disordered, however it adopts a coiled coil structure upon interaction with the tRNA (Goldgur et al. 1997).  <br><br>


					Editing in the bacterial PheRS is performed by the <a href="../phe2">&beta; subunit</a>. <br><br>
