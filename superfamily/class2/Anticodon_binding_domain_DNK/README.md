The anticodon binding domain DNK is a compact protein with an OB-fold (Charron et al. 2003). It resides at the C-termini of four Class II AARS: [AsxRS](/class2/asp2/), [AspRS](/class2/asp1/),  [AsnRS](/class2/asn/),  and  [LysRS-II](/class2/lys/), where it recognises the tRNA anticodon loop, approaching the acceptor stem from the major groove side (de Pouplana and Schimmel, 2001). 


In the standard genetic code, these three amino acids have very similar sets of cognate anticodons:  GAU/GAC for aspartate, AAU/AAC for asparagine, and AAA/AAG for lysine. It has been suggested that AspRS achieves its discrimination between $\text{tRNA}^\text{Asp}$ and $\text{tRNA}^\text{Asn}$ through a helix in the anticodon binding domain AspRS (Charron et al. 2003).
Similarly, the anticodon binding domain of LysRS-II specificially recognises the second and third positions of the anticodon, in order to discriminate against $\text{tRNA}^\text{Asn}$ (Cusack et al. 1996).
