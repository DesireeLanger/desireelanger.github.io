					The catalytic domain of the Class II amino acyl tRNA synthetase (AARS-II) activates amino acids so that their cognate tRNA can be charged. 
					In total, thirteen of the 22 proteinogenic amino acids are incorporated into the protein, through 21 distinct AARS-II families; a single representative from each of which is displayed below.
					These amino acids are alanine, asparagine, aspartate, cysteine, glycine, histidine, lysine, phenylalaline, proline, pyrrolysine, selenocysteine, serine, and threonine. 
					Lysine and cysteine are also incorporated during translation via the Class I amino acyl tRNA synthetases <a href="/class1/lys">LysRS-I</a> and <a href="/class1/cys">CysRS</a>. 
					 <br><br>



					Most AARS-II families are homodimeric. However, the <a href="/class2/phe1">cytosolic PheRS</a> and the bacterial <a href="/class2/gly2">GlyRS</a> exist as heterotetramers, while   <a href="/class2/sep">SepRS</a> is homotetrameric, and the <a href="/class2/phe5">mitochondrial PheRS</a> is monomeric.  <br><br>
					

					Although they are part of the class II catalytic domain superfamily, the &beta; subunits of the <a href="/class2/phe2">bacterial PheRS</a> and <a href="/class2/phe4">archaeal PheRS</a> families do not in fact catalyse amino acid activation (Klipcan et al. 2020). Instead, catalysis in these enzymes is performed by the respective &alpha; subunits <a href="/class2/phe1">PheRS-B&alpha;</a> and <a href="/class2/phe3">PheRS-A&alpha;</a>  .
					As such, these two &beta; chains are lacking the arginine tweezers which would normally coordinate ATP binding; one in motif 2 and the other in motif 3 (Kaiser et al. 2018).  <br><br>



					 The universal structure of AARS-II is described by three &alpha;-helices H1-H3, five &beta;-strands S1-S5, and a strand followed immediately by a helix SH1.
					 The catalytic domain itself is a six stranded anti-parallel &beta; fold. The first five strands are denoted by S1-S5, while the sixth strand is part of SH1. 
					 There is also a very short &beta;-strand, 2-3 residues in length, which resides within motif 1 and runs parallel with S1. 
					 The two arginine tweezers reside in S1 and SH1, which are in close proximity with one other.
					 The loops which connect these secondary structural elements are quite variable in length and contain a multitude of insertion modules (IM). <br><br>


					 All AARS-II members contain the same six antiparallel &beta;-strands bound by S1 (near the N-terminus) and S3 (>50 residues downstream), plus the short strand parallel to S1. 
					 However, some members contain additional strands which run parallel with S3. 
					 First, GlyRS-AE insertion module 2 is a small ~40 residue module which contains a &beta;-hairpin. This hairpin runs parallel with S3, and adds two additional strands to the fold for both dimeric GlyRS families <a href="/class2/gly1">GlyRS-A</a> and <a href="/class2/gly3">GlyRS-E</a>.
					 Second, the subclass 2b insertion module is over 70 residues and contains a short &beta; strand at its N-terminus which runs parallel to S3. 
					 This insertion module is found in <a href="/class2/lys">LysRS-II</a>, <a href="/class2/asn">AsnRS</a>, <a href="/class2/asp1">AspRS</a>, and <a href="/class2/asp2">AsxRS</a>. <br><br>

					 <!--  TODO: 3. His 4. Ala 5. Thr. Are Ala and Thr related, or is it convergent evolution?-->


					
					 There is a &beta; hairpin located between motifs 1 and 2; its two strands are denoted by BH1 and BH2. 
					 This element exists in most members of the superfamily, with the exception of subclass 2d (<a href="/class2/ala">AlaRS</a> and <a href="/class2/gly2">GlyRS-B&alpha;</a>). 
					 The hairpin is likely to have arisen early in the evolutionary history of AARS-II, and its loop has since seen the appearance of three insertion modules: SepRS IM, SerRS-A IM, and PheRS-A&alpha;-IM.
