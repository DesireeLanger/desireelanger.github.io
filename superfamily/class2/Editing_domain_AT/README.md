The post-transfer editing domain AT (EAT) catalyses the removal of misacylated serine residues from the cognate acceptor stems of alanine and threonine:


$ \text{Ser-tRNA}^\text{Ala} \xrightarrow{\text{EAT}} \text{Ser} + \text{tRNA}^\text{Ala} $

$ \text{Ser-tRNA}^\text{Thr} \xrightarrow{\text{EAT}} \text{Ser} + \text{tRNA}^\text{Thr} $


Paralogs of EAT exist at the N-terminal of [ThrRS](/class2/thr/), the C-terminal of [AlaRS](/class2/ala/), and in the form of the trans-acting factor AlaX, which also targets Ser-tRNA$^\text{Ala}$ (Beebe et al. 2008). This editing activity lowers the rate of serine-for-threonine and serine-for-alanine mistranslations; the latter is known to cause profound problems in nature (Guo et al. 2009a, Schimmel 2011).
